                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>Stress and accompanying physiological responses can occur when everyday emotional, mental and physical challenges exceed one’s ability to cope. 
                        Long-Term exposure to stressful situations can have negative health consequences, such as increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and immune system disorder. 
                        It is also shown to adversely affect productivity, wellbeing, and self-confidence, which can lead to social and economic inequality. 
                        Hence, timely stress recognition can contribute to better strategies for its management and prevention in the future. 
                        Stress can be detected from multimodal physiological signals (e.g., skin conductance and heart rate) using well-trained models. 
                        However, these models need to be adapted to a new target domain and personalized for each test subject. In this paper, we propose a deep reconstruction classification network and multitask learning (MTL) for domain adaptation and personalization of stress recognition models. 
                        The domain adaptation is achieved via a hybrid model consisting of temporal convolutional and recurrent layers that perform shared feature extraction through supervised source label predictions and unsupervised target data reconstruction. Furthermore, MTL based neural network approach with hard parameter sharing of mutual representation and task-specific layers is utilized to acquire personalized models. 
                        The proposed methods are tested on multimodal physiological time-series data collected during driving tasks, in both real-world and driving simulator settings.</p>

                    <h2>Model Adaptation</h2>
                    <p>
                    <b>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation.</b> We formulate model adaptation as a cross-domain and cross-user transfer learning problem. Here, a model trained on
                        a dataset collected in a specific setting (simulator) or source domain has to be adapted to perform the same task in a different situation (real-world) or target domain. 
                        There are several challenges for learning an optimal model in this case, such as unavailability of ground-truth for the target domain, expensive process of acquiring a large number of labels and dynamic shift in data distribution. 
                        Therefore, target data cannot be directly used for fine-tuning an existing model in a supervised manner. 
                        In this work, we utilize deep reconstruction and classification network for unsupervised domain adaptation to learn from source and target datasets jointly. 
                        This learning setting resembles MTL in the sense that learning an auxiliary task can help improve performance for the actual task through a shared representation. 
                        For more information see section II.B of [1].

                            A subject-independent global model for stress detection
                            may perform poorly due to large interpersonal variations in
                            physiological responses, e.g. due to age, gender, sleep,
                            and diet. In order to take these disparities into account, we
                            personalize a model by applying deep MTL with the subjects-as-tasks approach. 
                            MTL involves finding a unified model for solving more than one task with a
                            shared representation. In this work, we develop two model architectures for the MTL setting,
                            one based on the temporal convolutional neural network for end-to-end
                            representation learning and second a feed-forward neural network trained 
                            with manually extracted features from heart rate and skin conductance.
