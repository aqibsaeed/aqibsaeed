  abstract={Smartphones, wearables, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices produce a wealth of data that cannot be accumulated in a centralized repository for learning supervised models due to privacy, bandwidth limitations, and the prohibitive cost of annotations. Federated learning provides a compelling framework for learning models from decentralized data, but conventionally, it assumes the availability of labeled samples, whereas on-device data is generally either unlabeled or cannot be annotated readily through user interaction. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervised approach termed scalogram-signal correspondence learning based on wavelet transform to learn useful representations from unlabeled sensor inputs as electroencephalography, blood volume pulse, accelerometer, and WiFi channel state information. Our auxiliary task requires a deep temporal neural network to determine if a given pair of a signal and its complementary view (i.e., a scalogram generated with wavelet transform) align with each other or not, by optimizing a contrastive objective. We extensively assess the quality of learned features on diverse public datasets, achieving strong performance in all domains. We evaluate the quality of learned features on downstream tasks through linear classification, effectiveness in the low-data regime, transfer learning, and cross-validation. Our methodology achieves competitive performance with fully-supervised networks, and it works significantly better than pre-training with autoencoders in both central and federated contexts. Moreover, it considerably improves the generalization in a semi-supervised setting by reducing the volume of labeled data required through leveraging self-supervised learning.},
